# Data Science for Complex Systems: Economic System Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on modeling and analyzing economic systems through the lens of complex systems and network science. It is part of the "Data Science for Complex Systems" course content.

## üìÇ Contents

- `Code_and_Outputs_of_economic_system_models_and_PDF_of_eigenvalues.ipynb`: 
  The main notebook containing:
  - Construction of economic system models
  - Analysis of matrices representing economic networks
  - Calculation of eigenvalues
  - Visualization of the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the eigenvalues

## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate simplified economic networks using matrix-based approaches
- Apply eigenvalue analysis to evaluate system stability and structure
- Visualize how economic complexity is reflected in the spectral properties of the system

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

Install them using:

```bash
